	--- Squirrel Terminal Executables ---
-- Info --
Squirrel Terminal have a built-in supported fileformat 
with its own custom commands (cmdlets) readable. It's 
really easy to get started, just create a file with
the extention ".sqt" and Squirrel Terminal will be able
to read it with the command "read-file", just enter a
full file path to the .sqt file, or just the name if 
you're already inside the same directory as the file
itself.

-- Notes --
But there are a few things to keep in mind. Here's a
list over them:

- Leave no bland lines in your code, it will display an error when runned.

- The compiler reads only line -per line, which means you need to keep all
  your code blocks at one line only.
	Example: 
	if ($true) { #Do things; #More things; }
	Insted of:
	if ($true) {
	    #Do things;
	    #More things;
	}
